This repository provides public access to the code, analysis, and anonymized data associated with the political brain study in the manuscript "Functional Connectivity Signatures of Political Ideology" by Seo-Eun Yang, James D. Wilson (me), Zhong-Lin Lu, and Skyler Cranmer. Please send comments or questions to me at wilsonj41@upmc.edu or jdwilson4@usfca.edu.


## Accessing the Data 
Anonymized functional connectivity data for the 174 participants in the Wellbeing data set is available at this link:
