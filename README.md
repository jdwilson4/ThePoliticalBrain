# ThePoliticalBrain
This repository provides public access to the code, analysis, and anonymized data associated with the political brain study in the manuscript "Functional Connectivity Signatures of Political Ideology" by Seo-Eun Yang, James D. Wilson (me), Zhong-Lin Lu, and Skyler Cranmer. Please send comments or questions to me at wilsonja@pitt.edu.


## Accessing the Data 
Anonymized functional connectivity data for the 174 participants in the Wellbeing data set from the Ohio State University is available at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cI9ngWViE4TvO2wS7DwYMIKuKE8lJXXB/view?usp=sharing. This will bring you to a Google drive that requires permission to download. Please email me at wilsonj41@upmc.edu or jdwilson4@usfca.edu to request access. When you request access, please let me know the purpose of download, and cite the paper "Functional Connectivity Signatures of Political Ideology" by Seo-Eun Yang, James D. Wilson, Zhong-Lin Lu, and Skyler Cranmer. (DOI to come).

The data that can be downloaded will be a `mat` file called `tc.mat`. This can be opened directly using `Matlab`. Running BrainNetCNN below will require that you have `tc.mat` downloaded.
